                            <p class="content3">by Clement Clarke Moore <br><br></p>
                            
                            <p class="content5">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house <br>
                            Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>
                            The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
                            In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br><br>
                            The children were nestled all snug in their beds;<br>
                            While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br>
                            And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>
                            Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br><br>
                            When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
                            I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br>
                            Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
                            Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br><br>
                            The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br>
                            Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,<br>
                            When what to my wondering eyes did appear,<br>
                            But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,<br><br>
                            With a little old driver so lively and quick,<br>
                            I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.<br>
                            More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>
                            And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:<br><br>
                            "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!<br>
                            On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!<br>
                            To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>
                            Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br><br>
                            As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
                            When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br>
                            So up to the housetop the coursers they flew<br>
                            With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—<br><br>
                            And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>
                            The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
                            As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br>
                            Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br><br>
                            He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>
                            And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>
                            A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
                            And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br><br>
                            His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br>
                            His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
                            His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
                            And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;<br><br>
                            The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
                            And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
                            He had a broad face and a little round belly<br>
                            That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br><br>
                            He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
                            And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
                            A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br>
                            Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br><br>
                            He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
                            And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br>
                            And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
                            And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br><br>
                            He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
                            And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
                            But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—<br>
                            “Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”<br></p>

                                <p class="content2"> The time of swords and periwigs and full-skirted coats with flowered
                                lappets, when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of
                                silk and taffeta there lived a tailor in Gloucester. <br><br>
                                
                                He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on
                                a table, from morning till dark. <br><br>
                                
                                All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippeted, piecing out
                                his satin and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and
                                were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester. <br><br>
                                
                                But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very,
                                very poor, a little old man in spectacles, with a pinched face, old
                                crooked fingers, and a suit of thread-bare clothes. <br><br>
                                
                                He cut his coats without waste, according to his embroidered cloth; they
                                were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table.  "Too
                                narrow breadths for nothing except waistcoats for mice," said the tailor. <br><br/p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I2.jpeg" alt="Waistcoats for mice">
                                
                                <p class="content2">On a bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat, a
                                coat of cherry-coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses,
                                and a cream coloured satin waistcoat trimmed with gauze and green
                                worsted chenille, for the Mayor of Gloucester.<br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I3.jpeg" alt="A well dressed Miss">
                                
                                <p class="content2">The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself. He measured the
                                silk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his
                                shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets. <br><br>
                                
                                "No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets
                                for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!" said the Tailor of Gloucester. <br><br>
                                
                                When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and
                                shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and
                                satin lay cut out upon the table.<br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I5.jpeg" alt="The tailor leaves the shop">
                                
                                <p class="content2">There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat;
                                and there were pocket flaps and cuffs, and buttons all in order. For the
                                lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta; and for the button-holes
                                of the waistcoat, there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was
                                ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except
                                that there was wanting just one single piece of cherry-coloured twisted
                                silk. <br><br>
                                
                                The tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at
                                nights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key.
                                No one lived there at night but little brown mice, and they run in and out
                                without any keys!<br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I6.jpeg" alt="Down the street">
                                
                                <p class="content2">For behind the wooden skirting-boards of all the old houses in Gloucester, there
                                are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from
                                house to house through those long narrow passages; they can run all over
                                the town without going into the streets.<br><br>
                                
                                But the tailor came out of his shop, and shuffled home through the snow.
                                He lived quite near by in College Court, next to the doorway to College
                                Green; and although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only
                                rented the kitchen.<br><br>
                                
                                He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin. <br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I7.jpeg" alt="His cat Simkin">
                                
                                <p class="content2">All day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by
                                himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin
                                for coats! <br><br>
                                
                                "Miow?" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, "Miow?"<br><br>
                                
                                The tailor replied--"Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to
                                a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin,
                                take a china pot; buy a pennyworth of bread, a pennyworth of milk and a
                                pennyworth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our
                                fourpence buy me one pennyworth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose
                                the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a
                                thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST." <br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I8.jpeg" alt="Asleep in front of the fire">
                                
                                <p class="content2">Simpkin again said, "Miow?" and took the groat and the pot, and
                                went out into the dark. <br><br>
                                
                                The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the
                                hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.<br><br>
                                
                                "I shall make my fortune, the Mayor of Gloucester is to be
                                married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he has ordered a coat and an
                                embroidered waistcoat, to be lined with yellow taffeta but the taffeta
                                is not enough; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make
                                tippets for mice" <br><br>
                                
                                Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser
                                at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises-- <br><br>
                                
                                Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip! <br><br>
                                
                                "Now what can that be?" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his
                                chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pots, willow pattern
                                plates, and tea-cups and mugs. <br><br>
                                
                                The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser,
                                listening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a tea-cup,
                                came those funny little noises <br><br>
                                
                                Tip tap, tip tap, Tip tap tip! <br><br>
                                
                                "This is very peculiar," said the Tailor of Gloucester; and he lifted up
                                the tea-cup which was upside down. <br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I9.jpeg" alt="Asleep in front of the fire">
                                
                                <p class="content2">Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor!
                                Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the skirting-board. <br><br>
                                
                                The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and
                                mumbling to himself. <br><br>
                                
                                "The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin tambour stitch and
                                rose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence
                                to Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!" <br><br>
                                
                                But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:<br><br>
                                
                                Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!<br><br>
                                
                                "This is passing extraordinary!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and
                                turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!<br><br>
                                
                                And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all
                                sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old
                                worm-eaten window-shutter.<br><br>

                                And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other
                                and more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the
                                skirting-board.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting--"One-and-twenty
                                button-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of
                                Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those
                                mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have
                                no more twist!"<br><br>
                                
                                The little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took
                                notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one
                                another about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.<br><br>
                                
                                And then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind
                                the skirting-board, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house
                                to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin
                                came back with the pot of milk!<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry "G-r-r-miaw!" like a
                                cat that is vexed: for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears,
                                and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and
                                the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.<br><br>
                                
                                "Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my twist?"<br><br>
                                
                                But Simpkin set down the pot of milk upon the dresser, and looked
                                suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!<br><br>
                                
                                "Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my TWIST?"<br><br></p>
                                
                                <img class="image" src="./Tailor/I13.jpeg" alt="Asleep in front of the fire">
                                
                                <p class="content2">But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and
                                growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have
                                asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"<br><br>
                                
                                "Alas, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to
                                bed.<br><br>
                                
                                All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen,
                                peeping into cupboards and under the skirting-board, and into the tea-pot where
                                he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!<br><br>
                                
                                Whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said
                                "Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!" and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at
                                night.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in
                                his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled--"No more twist! no
                                more twist!"<br><br>
                                
                                All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should
                                become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate
                                Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the
                                table--one-and-twenty button-holes--and who should come to sew them, when
                                the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?<br><br>
                                
                                But that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out
                                without any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!</p>

                                <p class="content2">Out of doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their
                                geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no
                                Christmas dinner for Simpkin and the poor old Tailor of Gloucester.<br><br>
                                
                                The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas
                                Eve, and very late at night. The moon climbed up over the roof-tops and
                                chimneys, and looked down over the gateway into College Court. There were
                                no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of
                                Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow.<br><br>
                                
                                And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the
                                four-post bed.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">But it is in the old stories that all the beasts can talk, in the night
                                between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are
                                very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).<br><br>
                                
                                When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer, like an echo
                                of the chimes, and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door,
                                and wandered about in the snow.<br><br>
                                
                                From all the roof-tops and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a
                                thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes, all the old songs
                                that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's
                                bells.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">First and loudest the cocks cried out: "Dame, get up, and bake your pies!"<br><br>
                                
                                "Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!" sighed Simpkin.<br><br>
                                
                                And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came
                                from over the way.<br><br>
                                
                                "Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in
                                Gloucester except me," said Simpkin.<br><br>
                                
                                Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies;
                                the jack-daws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the
                                middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full
                                of little twittering tunes.<br><br></p>

                                Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a
                                wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very
                                small voices, especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep,
                                like the Tailor of Gloucester.<br><br>
                                
                                They said something mysterious that sounded like,<br><br>

                                and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.<br><br></p>

                                crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a
                                snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices
                                sang loudly and gaily,<br><br>

                                     What are you at, my fine little men?
                                     Making coats for gentlemen.
                                     Shall I come in and cut off your threads?
                                     Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!"<br><br>
                                
                                "Mew! Mew!" cried Simpkin. "Hey diddle dinketty?" answered the little
                                mice,<br><br>

                                     The merchants of London they wear scarlet;
                                     Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,
                                     So merrily march the merchantmen!"<br><br></p>

                                pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.<br><br>
                                
                                    "And then I bought
                                     A pipkin and a popkin,
                                     A slipkin and a slopkin,

                                and upon the kitchen dresser!" added the rude little mice.<br><br>
                                
                                "Mew! scratch! scratch!" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the
                                little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in
                                little twittering voices: "No more twist! No more twist!" And they barred
                                up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.<br><br>
                                
                                But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of
                                thimbles, and little mouse voices singing.<br><br></p>

                                Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He
                                found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.<br><br>
                                
                                Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the
                                tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of
                                his badness compared with those good little mice!<br><br>
                                
                                When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon
                                the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and
                                beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">"Alas, I am worn to a ravelling," said the Tailor of Gloucester, "but I
                                have my twist!"<br><br>
                                
                                The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and
                                came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.<br><br>
                                
                                The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins
                                sang, but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung
                                in the night.<br><br>
                                
                                "Alas," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength, nor
                                time, than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is
                                Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by
                                noon and where is his cherry-coloured coat?"<br><br>
                                
                                He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin
                                ran in, like a cat that expects something.<br><br>
                                
                                But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!<br><br>
                                
                                The boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk
                                snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.<br><br>
                                
                                But upon the table, oh joy! the tailor gave a shout, there, where he had
                                left plain cuttings of silk there lay the most beautifull coat and
                                embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.<br><br></p>

                                waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.<br><br></p>

                                <p class="content2">Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured
                                button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a
                                scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing,<br><br>

                                And from that day onwards began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite
                                stout, and he grew quite rich.<br><br>
                                
                                He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of
                                Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.<br><br></p>

                                The stitches of those button-holes were so neat, so neat! I wonder how
                                they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old
                                fingers, and a tailor's thimble.<br><br>
                                
                                The stitches of those button-holes were so small, so small, they looked

                                    <p class="content5">But the Grinch, <br> who lived just north of Whoville, <br> did NOT!<br><br>
                                    The Grinch hated Christmas! <br> The whole Christmas season!<br><br>
                                    Now, please don’t ask why. <br> No one quite knows the reason.<br><br><br>
                                    It could be his head <br> wasn’t screwed on just right.<br><br>
                                    It could be, perhaps, <br> that his shoes were too tight.<br><br>
                                    But I think that the most likely reason of all,<br><br>
                                    May have been that his heart was two sizes too small ...<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G2.png" alt="Grinch looking down the valley angrily.">

                                    <p class="content5">Whatever the reason, <br> his heart or his shoes,<br><br>
                                    He stood there on Christmas Eve, <br>hating the Whos,<br><br>
                                    Staring down from his cave <br>with a sour, Grinchy frown,<br><br>
                                    At the warm lighted windows<br> below in their town.<br><br>

                                    For he knew every Who <br> down in Whoville beneath<br><br>
                                    Was busy now hanging a hollywho wreath.<br><br>

                                    "And they're hanging their stockings,"<br> he snarled with a sneer.<br><br>
                                    "Tomorrow is Christmas! <br>It's practically here!"<br><br>

                                    Then he growled, <br>with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,<br><br>
                                    "I must find some way to keep Christmas from coming!<br><br>

                                    For, tomorrow, <br>I know all the Who girls and boys<br><br>
                                    Will wake bright and early. <br>They'll rush for their toys!<br><br>

                                    And then! Oh, the noise! <br>Oh, the noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!<br><br>
                                    There's one thing I hate! <br>All the NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!<br><br>

                                    And they'll shriek squeaks and squeals, <br>racing 'round on their wheels.<br><br>
                                    They'll dance with jingtinglers <br>tied onto their heels.<br><br>

                                    And they'll play noisy games <br>like zoozittacarzay,<br><br>
                                    A roller-skate type of <br>lacrosse and croquet!<br><br>

                                    Then the Whos, young and old,<br> will sit down to a feast.<br><br>
                                    And they'll feast! And they'll feast! <br>And they'll FEAST! FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!<br><br>

                                    They'll feast on Who pudding, <br>and rare Who roast beast,<br><br>
                                    Raw roast beast is a feast <br>I can't stand in the least!<br><br>

                                    And then they'll do something <br>I hate most of all!<br><br>
                                    Every Who down in Whoville, <br>the tall and the small,<br><br>

                                    They'll stand close together, <br>with Christmas bells ringing.<br><br>
                                    They'll stand hand-in-hand, <br>and those Whos will start singing!"<br><br>

                                    "And they'll sing! And they'll sing! <br>And they'd SING! SING! SING! SING!"<br><br>
                                    And the more the Grinch thought <br>of this Who Christmas Sing,<br><br>
                                    The more the Grinch thought, <br>"I must stop this whole thing!<br><br>

                                    Why for fifty-three years <br>I've put up with it now!<br><br>
                                    I must stop Christmas from coming! <br>But how?"<br><br>

                                    Then he got an idea! <br>An awful idea!<br><br>
                                    The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G3.png" alt="Grinch dresses as Santa Claus.">

                                    <p class="content5">"I know just what to do!" <br>The Grinch laughed in his throat.<br><br>
                                    "I'll make a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat."<br><br>

                                    And he chuckled, and clucked, <br>"What a great grinchy trick!<br><br>
                                    With this coat and this hat, <br>I'll look just like Saint Nick!"<br><br>

                                    "All I need is a reindeer." <br>The Grinch looked around.<br><br>
                                    But since reindeer are scarce, <br>there was none to be found.<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G4.png" alt="Grinch dresses his dog as a reindeer.">

                                    <p class="content5">Did that stop the Grinch? Hah! <br>The Grinch simply said,<br><br>
                                    "If I can't find a reindeer, <br>I'll make one instead!"<br><br>

                                    So he took his dog Max, <br>and he took some black thread.<br><br>
                                    And he tied a big horn <br>on top of his head.<br><br>

                                    Then he loaded some bags <br>and some old empty sacks<br><br>
                                    On a ramshackle sleigh <br>and he whistled for Max.<br><br>

                                    Then the Grinch said "Giddyap!" <br>and the sleigh started down<br><br>
                                    Toward the homes where the Whos <br>lay a-snooze in their town.<br><br>

                                    All their windows were dark. <br>No one knew he was there.<br><br>
                                    All the Whos were all dreaming <br>sweet dreams without care<br><br>
                                    When he came to the first little house of the square.<br><br>

                                    "This is stop number one," <br>the old Grinchy Claus hissed,<br><br>
                                    As he climbed to the roof, <br>empty bags in his fist.<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G5.png" alt="Grinch climbs down the chimney.">

                                    <p class="content5">Then he slid down the chimney, <br>a rather tight pinch.<br><br>
                                    But if Santa could do it, <br>then so could the Grinch.<br><br>

                                    He got stuck only once, <br>for a minute or two.<br><br>
                                    Then he stuck his head out <br>of the fireplace flue<br><br>

                                    Where the little Who stockings <br>hung all in a row.<br><br>
                                    "These stockings," he grinched, <br>"are the first things to go!"<br><br>

                                    Then he slithered and slunk, <br>with a smile most unpleasant,<br><br>
                                    Around the whole room, <br>and he took every present!<br><br>

                                    Pop guns, pampoogas, <br>pantookas, and drums!<br><br>
                                    Checkerboards, bizilbigs, <br>popcorn, and plums!<br><br>

                                    And he stuffed them in bags. <br>Then the Grinch, very nimbly,<br><br>
                                    Stuffed all the bags, <br>one by one, up the chimney.<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G6.png" alt="Grinch opens the fridge.">

                                    <p class="content5">Then he slunk to the icebox. <br>He took the Whos' feast!<br><br>
                                    He took the Who pudding! <br>He took the roast beast!<br><br>

                                    He cleaned out that icebox <br>as quick as a flash.<br><br>
                                    Why, that Grinch even took <br>the last can of Who hash!<br><br>

                                    Then he stuffed all the food <br>up the chimney with glee.<br><br>
                                    "Now," grinned the Grinch, <br>"I will stuff up the tree!"<br><br>

                                    As the Grinch took the tree, <br>as he started to shove,<br><br>
                                    He heard a small sound <br>like the coo of a dove.<br><br>

                                    He turned around fast, <br>and he saw a small Who!<br><br>
                                    Little Cindy-Lou Who, <br>who was no more than two.<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G7.png" alt="Grinch is caught by the little girl." style="width: 40vw;">

                                    <p class="content5">She stared at the Grinch and said, <br>"Santy Claus, why,<br><br>
                                    Why are you taking our Christmas tree? <br>Why?"<br><br>

                                    But, you know, that old Grinch <br>was so smart and so slick,<br><br>
                                    He thought up a lie, <br>and he thought it up quick!<br><br>

                                    "Why, my sweet little tot," <br>the fake Santy Claus lied,<br><br>
                                    "There's a light on this tree <br>that won't light on one side.<br><br>

                                    So I'm taking it home <br>to my workshop, my dear.<br><br>
                                    I'll fix it up there, <br>then I'll bring it back here."<br><br>

                                    And his fib fooled the child. <br>Then he patted her head,<br><br>
                                    And he got her a drink, <br>and he sent her to bed.<br><br>

                                    And when Cindy-Lou Who <br>was in bed with her cup,<br><br>
                                    He crept to the chimney <br>and stuffed the tree up!<br><br>

                                    Then he went up the chimney himself, <br>the old liar.<br><br>
                                    And the last thing he took <br>was the log for their fire.<br><br>
                                    On their walls he left nothing <br>but hooks and some wire.<br><br>

                                    And the one speck of food <br>that he left in the house<br><br>
                                    Was a crumb that was even <br>too small for a mouse.<br><br>

                                    Then he did the same thing <br>to the other Whos' houses,<br><br>
                                    Leaving crumbs much too small <br>for the other Whos' mouses!<br><br</p>

                                    He rode with his load<br> to the tiptop to dump it!<br><br>
                                    "Pooh-pooh to the Whos!"<br> he was grinchishly humming.<br><br>
                                    "They're finding out now <br>that no Christmas is coming!"<br><br>
                                    "They're just waking up!<br> I know just what they'll do!"<br><br>

                                    "That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, <br>"That I simply MUST hear!"<br><br>
                                    So he paused. <br>And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.<br><br>
                                    And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.<br><br>
                                    It started in low.<br> Then it started to grow.<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G10.png" alt="He stops to listen.">    

                                    <p class="content5">But the sound wasn't sad! <br>Why, this sound sounded merry!<br><br>
                                    It couldn't be so! <br>But it WAS merry! VERY!<br><br>
                                    He stared down at Whoville! <br>The Grinch popped his eyes!<br><br>
                                    Then he shook! <br>What he saw was a shocking surprise!<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G11.png" alt="He looks shocked.">

                                    <p class="content5">Every Who down in Whoville,<br> the tall and the small,<br><br>
                                    Was singing! <br>Without any presents at all!<br><br>
                                    He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming!<br> IT CAME!<br><br>
                                    Somehow or other, <br>it came just the same!<br><br></p>

                                    <img src="./Grinch/G12.png" alt="All the Whos are singing and holding hands." style="width: 40vw;">

                                    <p class="content5">And the Grinch,<br> with his grinch-feet<br> ice-cold in the snow,<br><br>
                                    Stood puzzling and puzzling:<br> "How could it be so?"<br><br>
                                    "It came with out ribbons!<br> It came without tags!"<br><br>
                                    "It came without packages,<br> boxes or bags!"<br><br>
                                    And he puzzled three hours,<br> till his puzzler was sore.<br><br>
                                    Then the Grinch thought of something <br>he hadn't before!<br><br>
                                    "Maybe Christmas," he thought,<br> "doesn't come from a store."<br><br>
                                    "Maybe Christmas...perhaps...<br>means a little bit more!"<br><br></p>

                                    <p class="content5">And what happened then?<br> Well...in Whoville they say,<br><br>
                                    That the Grinch's small heart<br> grew three sizes that day!<br><br>
                                    And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,<br><br>
                                    He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,<br><br>
                                    And he brought back the toys!<br> And the food for the feast!<br><br></p>

                                    <p class="content5">And he, HE HIMSELF!<br> The Grinch carved the roast beast!<br><br></p>
